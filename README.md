# recursive-cognition
The Recursive Cognition Explorer is a computational framework for modeling, visualizing, and analyzing recursive self-reference in thought systems. It explores the mathematical properties of systems that process their own states and feed them back into themselves, creating self-referential loops that evolve over time.
